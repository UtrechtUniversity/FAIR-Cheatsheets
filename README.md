# FAIR Cheatsheets

Welcome to our cheatsheets designed to assist you in enhancing the FAIRness of your research data and code! :sparkles:

We understand how challenging it can be for researchers to make your research outputs [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data). Nevertheless, the significance of ensuring the FAIRness of your data and code cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the transparency and influence of your research.

To simplify this task, we've put together a series of cheatsheets that provide easy-to-follow instructions for making your research outputs FAIR. Whether you're embarking on your journey in data and code publication or seeking to enhance your current practices, these cheatsheets provide actionable guidance that you can readily implement. The cheatsheets cover a range of topics, including data and code sharing, metadata, READMEs, and licensing. Additionally, we've included links to supplementary resources and tools that can further support you throughout your FAIRness journey.
