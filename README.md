# FAIR Cheatsheets
Make your research data and code FAIR with the UU FAIR Cheatsheets! :sparkles:

The Open Science Programme was established at the UU to accelerate the transition to Open Science, and to fundamentally alter the practice of education and research. The programme aims to make science more open, reliable, efficient and relevant to society by promoting ideas that contribute to the principles of accountability, replicability, integrity and openness of science.  

Due to the broad scope of this project, the programme is divided into five tracks. The FAIR data and software track focuses on how research data and software is managed. The objective is to make research data and software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). As part of this project, cheatsheets have been created in order to advance this objective. These cheatsheets–one focused on data and another one focused on code–are intended for researchers and, ultimately, provide actionable measures that will compel researchers to publish their data and code in a FAIR manner. Considering the future of the Open Science Programme, it is the aim of the FAIR data and software track to continuously improve the current cheatsheets, but also to create specific cheatsheets for each faculty to clarify differentiating approaches, as well as creating cheatcheets on more specific types of data, e.g. qualitative data. 

## Contributions are welcome! :star:

In order to advance this project of the FAIR cheat sheets, your contributions are very much appreciated. :raised_hands: Possible ways get yourself involved are:

### Contribute to data or code cheatsheet :pencil:

- Add or improve FAIR "actions"
- Textual improvements
- Add references

### Create a new FAIR cheatsheet using the template :page_facing_up:

- Create a FAIR cheatsheet for your specific output based on this template
- Make topic specific cheatsheets
