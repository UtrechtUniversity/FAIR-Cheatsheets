# FAIR Cheatsheets
Make your research data and code FAIR with the UU FAIR Cheatsheets! :sparkles:

The Open Science Programme was established at the UU to accelerate the transition to Open Science, and to fundamentally alter the practice of education and research. The programme aims to make science more open, reliable, efficient and relevant to society by promoting ideas that contribute to the principles of accountability, replicability, integrity and openness of science.  

Due to the broad scope of this project, the programme is divided into five tracks. The FAIR data and software track focuses on how research data and software is managed. The objective is to make research data and software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). As part of this project, cheatsheets have been created in order to advance this objective. These cheatsheets–one focused on data and another one focused on code–are intended for researchers and, ultimately, provide actionable measures that will compel researchers to publish their data and code in a FAIR manner. Considering the future of the Open Science Programme, it is the aim of the FAIR data and software track to continuously improve the current cheatsheets, but also to create specific cheatsheets for each faculty to clarify differentiating approaches, as well as creating cheatcheets on more specific types of data, e.g. qualitative data. 

 

## Contributions are welcome! :star:

In order to advance this project of the FAIR cheat sheets, your contributions are very much appreciated. :raised_hands:

Contributions are welcome in a number of ways. Possible ways include: 

### Contributing to exiting data cheatsheet and code cheatsheets :pencil:		 

- Textual improvements  
- Improve unclear items 
- Report typos  

 
### Create your own FAIR cheatsheet using the template :page_facing_up:

- Create a cheatsheet more specific for your faculty based on this design template 
- Make topic specific cheatsheets 

 
This can be done by accessing the:  

- [FAIR cheatsheet template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFefwco7Os/FWtDm6-BLR7NSL1f8TVNIg/edit?utm_content=DAFefwco7Os&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) which is a general template of the cheatsheet design 
- Or the already existing Data and Code cheatsheets  

 

## What files are available (e.g. Canva etc.) and how this works 

The current data cheatsheet is available on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Canva is a free-to-use online graphic design and publishing tool. On this platform, it is easy to work on the same design with multiple people as a team. The cheat sheet can be downloaded as a JPG, PNG or PDF from the website.  

 
## How to contribute
