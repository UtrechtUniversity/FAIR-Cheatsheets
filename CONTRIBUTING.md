## What files are available (e.g. Canva etc.) and how this works

You can access the latest data cheatsheet via [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), a free-to-use online graphic design and publishing tool. Canva makes collaborative work a breeze, allowing multiple team members to collaborate on the same design seamlessly. The cheatsheet can be downloaded as a JPG, PNG or PDF from the website.
