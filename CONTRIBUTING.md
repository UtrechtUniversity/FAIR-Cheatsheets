## Ways to contribute to the Cheatsheets

Contributions are welcome in a number of ways. Possible ways include:

### Contributing to exiting data cheatsheet and code cheatsheets :pencil:

- Textual improvements 
- Improve unclear items
- Report typos


### Create your own FAIR cheatsheet using the template :page_facing_up:

- Create a cheatsheet more specific for your faculty based on this design template
- Make topic specific cheatsheets


This can be done by accessing the:

- [FAIR cheatsheet template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFefwco7Os/FWtDm6-BLR7NSL1f8TVNIg/edit?utm_content=DAFefwco7Os&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) which is a general template of the cheatsheet design
- Or the already existing [Data and Code cheatsheets](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFbwCJqZZU/ec6rkzFDDEVdxLkwFlFatA/edit?analyticsCorrelationId=2d93fe67-cdde-4a63-ba46-85e36193d6c1)



## What files are available (e.g. Canva etc.) and how this works

The current data cheatsheet is available on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Canva is a free-to-use online graphic design and publishing tool. On this platform, it is easy to work on the same design with multiple people as a team. The cheat sheet can be downloaded as a JPG, PNG or PDF from the website.
