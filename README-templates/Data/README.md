## Prerequisites

Instructions how to ...

## Folder contents

Describe the contents of your data package. This is especially 
interesting if there are multiple files. Start with describing the 
folder structure, what you can expect in each folder and then the files. 
You can make a table or filetree if you think that is useful for the project. 

## Codebook

A codebook explains the variables in the dataset(s). This is interesting for 
tabular dataset, but also all kinds of other files. Give at minimum the name 
of the variable, a description, and the type. A format can be:

| Variable | Description             | Type                                  |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| my_var   | Description of the var  | Type of the var, e.g. string, integer |
